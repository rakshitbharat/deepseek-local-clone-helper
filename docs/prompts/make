we are aiming to download all things from hugginface of deepseek but in a compressed version but we have to be very sure about all the things that in future when we extract the archives we dont have any problem
currently we are not having that much of infra that when we do git clone and enabled 
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
we are not having the resources to even extract the repo and we dont have that much space
so current goal is to download all git repos from hugginface and use
git lfs later
